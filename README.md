## Developing a unified GUI for electrode trajectory planning and MRID-tag based localisation

**This code and read.me is in development and not yet finished**
In addition to using the general functionalities for visualising 3D and 4D MRI images, MRID-tag painting can be found in this repo.


Furthermore, parts of the 3D (brain) segmentation and MRI Registration can be found but are not yet finished.

## Developing a unified GUI for electrode trajectory planning and MRID-tag based localisation





This repository contains a unified graphical user interface (GUI) for the Neurotechnology Group, a joint lab of UZH and ETH Zurich.

Currently, the GUI, currently, focuses on  electrode trajectory planning and magnetic resonance identification (MRID)-tag based localisation but it is planned to expand its functionality.

MRID-tags are tiny Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)-visible barcodes integrated into electrode bundles, which are implanted inside brains. Precise identification of the implant's tag location and brain region is essential for accurately analysing the experimental data and correctly assigning the recorded neural signals. 




In addition to using the general functionalities for visualising 3D and 4D MRI images, MRID-tag painting can be found in this repo.


Furthermore, parts of the 3D (brain) segmentation and MRI Registration can be found but are not yet finished.
